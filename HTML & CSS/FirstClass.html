<p><p> Educators Edge</p>
    The Educators in collaboration with Knowledge Platform brings you The Educators Edge that will use communication and information technologies to enhance and expand the traditional role of education in The Educators community. We believe the basic goal of education has not changed, that is to prepare our students for life-long learning and success in an evolving society. However, the tools and instructional methods to achieve these goals have advanced dramatically. Technologies such as computers, networks, and wide area communications offer tremendous opportunities to students and teachers as a way to improve life within our community and a link to the outside world.
    
    It is a captivating online learning space providing students with the tools they need in order to be successful learners both in the classroom and beyond.
